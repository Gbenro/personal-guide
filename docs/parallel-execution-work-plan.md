# Personal Guide: Parallel Execution Work Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-09-15
**Total Tasks Analyzed:** 88 TODO tasks
**Parallel Capacity:** 10 immediate + 15 near-term = 25 simultaneous tasks

## Executive Summary

This document identifies which tasks can be executed simultaneously to accelerate development from the current **1 active task** to **10-15 parallel workstreams**. Tasks are categorized by dependencies and organized into independent execution tracks.

## Current Bottleneck Analysis

**Problem:** Only 1 task in progress (Architecture Design)
**Impact:** 87 tasks waiting, poor velocity

- Performance-critical features

### Major Phase Dependencies (40+ tasks)
- Need Phase 1 Foundation complete
- PWA implementation tasks
- Advanced feature implementations
- Testing and deployment tasks

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Week 1: Immediate Start (10 tasks)
```
Day 1-2: Start all 10 independent tasks
Day 3-5: Complete quick wins (error tracking, monitoring)
Day 5-7: Complete Zustand, UX designs
```

### Week 2: Scale to 15 active (Add 5 tasks)
```
Architecture completes → Start Phase 1
Zustand completes → Start React Query
UX designs complete → Start UI implementation
Schemas complete → Start API development
```

### Week 3: Full Parallel Execution (20+ tasks)
```
Foundation complete → Start all major phases
State management complete → Start optimizations
API endpoints complete → Start integrations
```

## Resource Allocation

### Specialist Workload Distribution
