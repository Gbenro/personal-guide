- **Performance**: Dashboard load time < 1s, smooth animations
- **AI Value**: % of users using AI recommendations, pattern accuracy
- **Retention**: 7-day and 30-day retention rates

## Dependencies

1. Mood tracking enables â†’ AI pattern recognition
2. Context tracking enables â†’ Personalized recommendations
3. Zustand enables â†’ Cleaner component development
4. React Query enables â†’ Real-time sync implementation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Data Privacy**: Implement proper consent for context tracking
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size with each feature
- **Complexity**: Use feature flags for progressive rollout
- **AI Costs**: Cache AI insights, batch processing
